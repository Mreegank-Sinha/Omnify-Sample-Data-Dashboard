## Overview
This project involves analyzing a raw dataset containing booking information for a multi-service business, including class bookings, subscriptions, facility rentals, and birthday party reservations. The dataset was cleaned and processed using PostgreSQL and Excel, addressing inconsistencies and missing values. Key insights were derived through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and an interactive dashboard was built in Power BI to visualize revenue trends, customer preferences, and booking patterns. The repository includes SQL queries, data cleaning steps, the Power BI dashboard file, and a detailed report documenting the entire workflow.

## Problem Statement
A multi-service business requires a data-driven approach to optimize its booking management and revenue tracking. The existing raw dataset, containing class bookings, subscriptions, facility rentals, and birthday party reservations, is inconsistent, incomplete, and unstructured. Without proper data cleaning and analysis, identifying key trends, customer preferences, and revenue-generating services becomes challenging. This project aims to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset through an interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on booking trends, customer behavior, and revenue insights.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of booking information , covering various services such as class bookings, subscriptions, facility rentals, and birthday party reservations. The dataset is structured with multiple columns, each representing different attributes related to bookings, customers, and services. Given its real-world nature, the dataset contains inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information that require cleaning and preprocessing.
